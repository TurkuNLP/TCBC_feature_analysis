# Project for feature analysis on the Turku Children's Book Corpus

Due to copyright, we cannot directly share the corpus used in the paper.

However, all results displayed in the various notebooks (.ipynb) have been computed for the original corpus, so the original results can be viewed from them.

KFA_Experiment.ipnyb contains the codes used to get all the results reported in the Key Feature Analysis section.

ML_Result_Interpretation.ipynb contains the code used to get all the results reported in the Machine Learning section.

Other notebooks and Python files have been used in creating the datasets used in the machine learning section, as well as to run and train both the linear classifiers as well as FinBERT.

Source files for the figures displayed in the paper are also provided.
